[Check it out here!](https://pleeko.github.io/mtg-data-tools/)

This tool was created to make the process of magic card inventory management easier. I Found the process of adding cards scanned in from the TCG Player app to my Deckbox account to be quite tedious.

Simply paste in your card list data and select the appropriate output format. If you have any suggestions or wish to have more output or input formats supported please open an issue on the github project.
